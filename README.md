# yet another bootstrapper ðŸŒ¯
A CLI tool that lets you save and bootstrap templates quick and easily.

All templates must be initialized manually, none come out of the box.  The good news is you can make anything a template, just pop it into a directory and `yab this <name>` and boom thats it.

yab automatically removes `.git/`, `node_modules/` and `bower_components/` directories when you create a new template.

## great for
- adding certain files/directories quickly to a project (ex. gulpfile.js)
- scaffolding an entire project (ex. express.js, vue.js, etc.)
- never having to keep and maintain scaffolds/template directories again
- keeping branding items like logos in a template to easily insert into a project
- prevent copy/pasting the same files and directories


## installation
```bash
npm install -g yab
```

## usage
yab keeps its interface simple with only four commands:

```bash
# Create a new template of the current directory and give it a name.
# yab will save an entire copy of the directory
yab this <name>
```

```bash
# Scaffold the current directory with a template.
# yab will add the template to the current directory
yab <name>
```

```bash
# List the current templates saved in yab.
yab list
```

```bash
# Remove a template.
yab remove <name>
```

## storage
yab stores the templates under the `~/.yab` directory.  Each template is stored and compressed in a `.zip` file.  Feel free to manually insert or remove zip files into this directory for yab to use.

> **Tip:** Verison control your `~/.yab` directory to sync templates across different computers.

## inspiration
I created this CLI tool because I found myself always keeping an empty project directory for some small NPM projects so I can easily scaffold them.  I wanted a way to be able to generate these scaffolds with a command.

Some CLI generators like [yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) require too much effort to create a generator.  They're great for common bootstraps, but for small or customized scaffolds it's not worth the effort.  yab bridges that gap.
